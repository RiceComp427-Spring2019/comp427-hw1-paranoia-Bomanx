## Rational Paranoia
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in
[MarkDown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and will be rendered to beautiful HTML when you visit your GitHub repo.

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Bowen Yang

_Student NetID_: by11

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {G20}
- Assumptions:
  - I am overseeing the security for the G20 summit, inexplicably scheduled for Houston this July. I am in charge of all police forces and I am able to coordinate with the city government. Not only should I secure the summit venue from any threats, but also I need to make sure that the stay of leaders is safe. Due to the priority of the safety, citizens’ daily activities may be influenced and limited in the duration of G20.
- Assets:
  - Leaders of G20 members. —Leaders’ safety is our top priority. We need to protect them at any cost. 
  - Citizens. —In addition to the leaders’ safety, we want to keep citizens and police forces safe as well.
  - The summit venue. —Maybe not as important but still an asset.
- Threats:
  - Terrorists. —Terrorists is our top threat. There is no need to explain how appealing the gathering of the most important people in the world is to the terrorists.  The forms of terrorism may be suicidal attack, presetting bombs, or even air strikes. 
  - Riots. —People may be provoked somehow and starts a riot.  In that case the main goal is to protect the national leaders.
- Countermeasures:
  - Reinforce the identity check at every possible chance; hotels, airports and so on, for instance. A simple background check for every new comer to the city is necessary.
  - Make sure the transportations of the leaders are clear and safe. To do so, locking down the roads near the venue and lockdown/limit the roads near where the leaders stay. Also lockdown the road when leaders are on their way. 
  - Security guards should be arranged heavily around the venue and the leaders’ accommodations 24/7. Not only should every entrance/exit be guarded, snipers on rooftops should be deployed as well.
  - Enhance the surveillance of the city. Prohibit anyone from carrying anything that may be used as a weapon. 
  - Deploy riot squad around the venue. If a riot started the riot squad can intervene early.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: {Grading}
- Assumptions:
  - I am grading homework submissions for a class of 200+ students, and they all submit their homework via a system like canvas. I then download their homework to grade, and submit their scores on the system. Hacking canvas should be a hard task that a student can barely do; therefore, an easier way to do anything with the homework is to target me directly. 
- Assets:
  - Students’ homework.
  - Grades of students’ homework.
  - Students’ confidential information.
- Threats:
  - Students may want to modify their homework.
  - Students may want to make their late submission legal. —There seems to be two ways to accomplish the first two threats: Hacking to my computer and modifying the homework directly on my computer.
  - Students may wan to change their scores.
  - Other groups may want to get the confidential information of the students.
- Countermeasures:
  - The easiest way that I can come up with is to download the homework of students in a private network on a clean computer, and then I print all the homework. After the printing, I delete the homework immediately and starting grading. After grading I will destroy the prints. I then submit the scores on canvas. However, this would not work for coding assignments and it is not environment-friendly. 
  - If I were to grade coding homework, I can grade them on a safe ssh client, Clear, for instance. I assume that Clear has a strong firewall than my personal computer and is very hard to hack as well.
  - To keep my personal computer safe, I will store it in a safe and use it only when grading.
  - The scores once posted on canvas will not be allowed to change unless someone hacks canvas. 

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Public library
- Assumptions:
  - I am in charge of the security of a public library in Houston. There are regular books in the library as well as rare journals; records of Houston infrastructure, all Houston Chronicles since 1950s, eg. There are electric detectors in the entrance. The library utilizes an online system to keep the records of borrowing/returning books.
- Assets:
  - Books
  - Journals
  - Library hardwares —Desks and chairs as well as the computers.
- Threats:
  - People may want to “smuggle” books out of the library.
  - A borrower may not want to return the book.
  - Young children may scratch/break desks and chairs.
  -  Terrorists may, at a small chance but still, target the library. 
- Countermeasures:
  - At the entrance everyone should go through a security check where bags should be scanned under X-ray, so that any suspicious items are not allowed to be taken into the library.
  - A small electronic chip should be attached onto every book and journal. If anyone is trying to take the books out without permission, the detector can tell.
  - A few guards should always be patrolling in the library in case of anything fishy going on. 
  - Every borrower should register in the library system with their personal information. When a borrowed book has passed its due date, the borrower should pay for the fines. In the worst case, the library may sue the borrower.
